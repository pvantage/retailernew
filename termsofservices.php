<p>If you breach any of these Terms, the above license will terminate automatically and you must immediately cease using and delete or destroy any downloaded, electronic or printed Materials.</p>
<h2>Using the Site and the Services on the Site</h2>
<p>You can simply view the Site and not use any Services on the Site.  You need not register with Company to simply visit and view the Site.</p>
<p>However, in order to access certain password-restricted areas of the Site (such as the subscriber or member areas) and to use certain Services and Materials offered on and through the Site, you must register with Company for an account and receive a password.</p>
<h2>Password Restricted Areas of this Site</h2>
<p>If you desire to register for an account with Company, you must submit the following information through the account registration page on the Site:  your first name, last name, company name, email address, and website password.  You will also have the ability to provide additional optional information, such as company size and work phone number, which is not required to register for an account but may be helpful to Company in providing you with a more customized experience when using the Site or its Services.  Once you have submitted your account registration information, you will be automatically approved and logged in to the system.</p>
<p>Currently, Company provides you with the ability to register for an account on the Site using your existing account and log-in credentials through LinkedIn Connect and in the future possible other third party sites (the "Third-Party Websites").  The Third-Party Websites may change from time to time.  (each of those log-in credentials, a "Third-Party Site Password").</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Company Password and any Third-Party Site Password (collectively, "Passwords), and you are responsible for all activities that occur using your Passwords. You agree not to share your Passwords, let others access or use your Passwords or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your Passwords.  You agree to notify Company if any of your Passwords on this Site is lost, stolen, if you are aware of any unauthorized use of your Passwords on this Site or if you know of any other breach of security in relation to this Site.</p>
<p>All the information that you provide when registering for an account and otherwise through the Site must be accurate, complete and up to date.  You may change, correct or remove any information from your account by either logging into your account directly (currently at <a href="http://www.sigmaways.com/members/settings/profile">http://www.sigmaways.com/members/settings/profile</a>) and making the desired changes or contacting Company using the contact information at the end of these Terms requesting that we make the change. </p>
<p>If you register for a "beta account" or other pre-release version of the Site and/or the Services and Materials on the Site ("Beta Release"), you acknowledge and agree that the Beta Release may contain, in Company sole discretion, more or fewer features or different licensing terms than a subsequent commercial release version of the Site and/or Services that may be offered through the Site.  You acknowledge and agree that any "beta account" will automatically convert to a commercial release version account upon the launch date of the Site and its Services to the public ("Public Launch Date").   If you do not desire to continue using the Site or its Services after the Public Launch Date, you may contact Company to delete your account in accordance with the terms and conditions governing deletion of personal information set forth in Companys Privacy Policy.  While Company generally intends to distribute commercial release versions of the Site and the Services and Materials on the Site, Company reserves the right not to release later commercial release versions of any Beta Release.  Without limiting any disclaimer of warranty or other limitation stated herein, you agree that any Beta Release is not considered by Company to be suitable for commercial use, and that it may contain errors affecting its proper operation.  BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF A BETA RELEASE MAY EXHIBIT SPORADIC DISRUPTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IN GENERAL AND ANY SERVICES THAT MAY BE OFFERED THROUGH THE SITE.  COMPANY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY BETA RELEASE.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions and Payment</h2>
<p>By registering for an account with Company, you become a "Subscriber" with access to certain password-restricted areas of the Site and to use certain Services and Materials offered on and through the Site (a "Subscription").  Each Subscription and the rights and privileges provided to a Subscriber is personal and non-transferable.  All sales and payments of Subscription fees will be in US Dollars.</p>
<p>The fee that we will charge you for your Subscription will be the price posted on the Site or otherwise communicated to you on the date that you register as a Subscriber. Company reserves the right to change prices for Subscriptions at any time, and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases.</p>
<p>You may pay for your Subscription fee only with credit and debit card payments (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover).  We will charge your credit or debit card for your first Subscription fee on the date that we process your order for your Subscription (or if you sign-up for a Subscription that includes a free-trial period, we will charge your credit or debit card for your first Subscription fee upon the expiration date of the applicable free-trial period).  After your credit or debit card is charged the first Subscription fee (or if you sign-up for a Subscription that includes a free-trial period, once we have processed your order for your Subscription), you will receive a confirmation e-mail notifying you of your ability to access those Subscription-only portions of, and Materials on, the Site.</p>
<p>With respect to receipts, we typically send a receipt of payment after you enroll for a paid subscription. If you add a credit card during a free-trial period and we do not process your payment at that time, Sigmaways will process your payment when the trial ends.  You will not be sent a receipt, however.  You can select to receive receipts when we charge your credit card.  Unless you configure your account to receive receipts, this feature will be disabled and you will not receive a receipt.</p>
<p>You may have one or more subscriptions. You must have a separate subscription for each website or project. Please review our website for our then-current pricing.  Each subscription is treated separately under an account. Under your account, you can associate a subscription with the same or different credit cards as other subscriptions.</p>
<p><u>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</u> COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR MEMBERSHIP ON EACH MONTHLY OR YEARLY ANNIVERSARY OF THAT DATE THAT COMPANY FIRST CHARGES YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD FOR THE FIRST SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND, AS AUTHORIZED BY YOU DURING THE SUBSCRIPTION SIGN-UP PROCESS, COMPANY WILL CHARGE YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD WITH THE APPLICABLE YEARLY OR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY SALES OR SIMILAR TAXES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAYMENT (UNLESS YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO THE ANNIVERSARY DATE). IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A SUBSCRIPTION THAT INCLUDES A FREE-TRIAL PERIOD, UNLESS YOU HAVE CANCELLED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE FREE-TRIAL PERIOD, AS AUTHORIZED BY YOU DURING THE SUBSCRIPTION SIGN-UP PROCESS, COMPANY WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOU FOR THE FIRST YEARLY OR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE, AS APPLICABLE, UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE FREE-TRIAL PERIOD AND EACH SUBSEQUENT YEARLY OR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION FEE ON THE YEARLY OR MONTHLY ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE OF THE FIRST BILLING. EACH SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR OR MONTH, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF SUBSCRIPTION SELECTED.  YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING COMPANY. YOU ALSO MAY CHANGE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, IN WHICH CASE THE SYSTEM WILL DOWNGRADE YOU AND ISSUE A PRO-RATED ACCOUNT CREDIT.  COMPANY REQUIRES A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROCESS YOUR SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION REQUEST.  IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT YEARLY OR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID, AND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT TERM.</p>
<p>You will be liable for paying any and all applicable sales and use taxes for the purchase of your subscription based on the mailing address that you provide when you register as a subscriber, and you authorize Company to charge your credit or debit card for any such applicable taxes.</p>
